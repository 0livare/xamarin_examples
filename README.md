# Xamarin Examples
A few dummy, but compiling, Xamarin Forms applications.

## ChefTest3 
This is a completely basic Hello World application.  The extent of its functionality is to display a label in the middle of the screen.  However, it does compile for iOS, Android, UWP, Windows, and Windows Phone.

## ChefTest4
This project is slightly more than a Hello World app.  It basically loops through all the available colors and displays them nicely in a scrollable list view.  It also compiles for all five platforms.

These projects were built in May 2016 with Visual Studio 2015 Service Pack 2.
